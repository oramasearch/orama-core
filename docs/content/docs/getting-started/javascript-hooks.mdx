Orama ❤️ JavaScript. Since day zero, we've been working on JavaScript solutions and we're excited to bring this love to OramaCore.

We believe that JavaScript is the _**lingua franca**_ of the web, and we want to make it easy for developers to use JavaScript to customize OramaCore.

## What are JavaScript Hooks?

JavaScript hooks are a way to customize OramaCore using JavaScript. You can use JavaScript hooks to:

- Customize text extraction and transformation
- Implement custom business logic
- Integrate with third-party services
- Write your own agents and actions
- And much more!

At the time of writing, we're working on a set of JavaScript hooks that you can use to customize OramaCore. We're planning to release the first version of JavaScript hooks in **v1.0.0**.

## Creating a Hooks

Once you have created a collection, you can create a JavaScript hook by sending a POST request to the `/v0/hooks` endpoint.

Here's an example of how to create a JavaScript hook:

```bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/{COLLECTION_ID}/v0/hooks/add \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "id": "selectEmbeddingProperties",
    "code": "function selectEmbeddingProperties(document) { return document.title; }"
  }'
```

Before inserting the hook, OramaCore will validate the JavaScript code to ensure it's safe to run. If the code is invalid, OramaCore will return an error.

## Available Hooks

Right now, OramaCore supports only one JavaScript hook (with the plan of adding dozens in the near future).

### `selectEmbeddingProperties`

The `selectEmbeddingProperties` hook allows you to customize the text extraction and transformation process.

You can use this hook to select the properties of the document that will be used to generate the embeddings.

This hook receives a single document as input and must return one of the following:

- `string[]`: An array of strings with the properties to use
- `string`: A single string with the concatenated properties
- `string`: A single string with the text to use for embeddings

Given that OramaCore is schemaless, this hook is particularly useful to customize the text extraction process depending on the document structure, which can vary from document to document.

Let's take the following documents as an example:

```json title="document1.json"
{
  "productName": "Wireless Headphones",
  "description": "The best wireless headphones for music lovers",
  "price": 99.99,
  "brand": "Sony"
}
```

```json title="document2.json"
{
  "title": "Extra Bass Wireless Portable Speaker",
  "description": "The best portable speaker for music lovers. Enjoy the extra bass!",
  "price": 149.99,
}
```

As you can see, the structure of the documents is different. With the `selectEmbeddingProperties` hook, you can customize the text extraction process for each document.

### Returning a single string

You could write a JavaScript function like this:

```javascript title="selectEmbeddingProperties.js"
function selectEmbeddingProperties(document) {
  if (document.productName && document.description && document.brand) {
    return [document.productName, document.description, document.brand].join(". ");
  }

  if (document.title && document.description) {
    return [document.title, document.description].join(". ");
  }

  return document.title || document.description || document.productName || document.brand;
}
```

Which will return the following strings for the documents:

- For `document1.json`:

  ```javascript
  "Wireless Headphones. The best wireless headphones for music lovers Sony"
  ```

- For `document2.json`:

  ```javascript
  "Extra Bass Wireless. Portable Speaker The best portable speaker for music lovers. Enjoy the extra bass!"
  ```

This way, you can easily produce highly optimized embeddings for each document.

### Returning a single markdown string

Another approach is to return a single markdown string that will be used for embeddings:

````javascript title="selectEmbeddingProperties.js"
function selectEmbeddingProperties(document) {
  const isDocumentType1 = document.productName && document.description && document.brand;

  if (isDocumentType1) {
    return ```
      ## Title
      ${document.productName}
      ## Description
      ${document.description}
      ## Brand
      ${document.brand}
    ```
  }

  return ```
    ## Title
    ${document.title}
    ## Description
    ${document.description}
  ```
}
````

This will produce the following outputs for the two documents:

- For `document1.json`:

  ```plaintext
  ## Title
  Wireless Headphones
  ## Description
  The best wireless headphones for music lovers
  ## Brand
  Sony
  ```

- For `document2.json`:

  ```plaintext
  ## Title
  Extra Bass Wireless Portable Speaker
  ## Description
  The best portable speaker for music lovers. Enjoy the extra bass!
  ```

This approach allows you to generate complete markdown documents rich in information that can be used for embeddings.

### Returning an array of strings

Finally, you can return an array of strings with the properties name to use for each document. OramaCore will then concatenate the values of these properties to generate the embeddings.

```javascript title="selectEmbeddingProperties.js"
function selectEmbeddingProperties(document) {
  if (document.productName && document.description && document.brand) {
    return ["productName", "description", "brand"];
  }

  return ["title", "description"];
}
```

This will produce the following outputs for the two documents:

- For `document1.json`:

  ```json
  ["productName", "description", "brand"]
  ```

- For `document2.json`:

  ```json
  ["title", "description"]
  ```

There is no right or wrong way to use the `selectEmbeddingProperties` hook. You can use it in the way that best fits your needs and the structure of your documents.
