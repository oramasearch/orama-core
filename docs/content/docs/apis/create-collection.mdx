import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

<Callout type='warn'>
At the time of writing, the OramaCore APIs are in beta. We can guarantee that the APIs **will change** in a way that breaks existing applications.

We will make these APIs stable in the v1.0.0 release, planned for February 28th, 2025.
</Callout>

We can think of collections as a way to group documents together.

For example, if you want to index all the products in your e-commerce store, you might want to create a collection called `products`, where each document represents a single product.

## APIs

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['JavaScript', 'cURL']}>

```javascript tab="JavaScript"
import { OramaCore } from '@orama/core';

const orama = new OramaCore({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  apiKey: '<api-key>'
})

const newCollection = orama.collections.create({
  name: 'products'
})
```

```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v0/collections \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -d '{ "name": "products" }'
```

</Tabs>
