import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

<Callout type='warn'>
At the time of writing, the OramaCore APIs are in beta. We can guarantee that the APIs **will change** in a way that breaks existing applications.

We will make these APIs stable in the v1.0.0 release, planned for February 28th, 2025.
</Callout>

We can think of collections as a way to group documents together.

For example, if you want to index all the products in your e-commerce store, you might want to create a collection called `products`, where each document represents a single product.

## APIs

Creating a new collection is as simple as:

<Tabs groupId='create' persist items={['cURL']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v0/collections \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -d '{
    "id": "products",
    "write_api_key": "my-write-api-key",
    "read_api_key": "my-read-api-key"
  }'
```
</Tabs>

A more complete example, with all the optional fields:

<Tabs groupId='create' persist items={['cURL']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v0/collections \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -d '{
    "id": "products",
    "write_api_key": "my-write-api-key",
    "read_api_key": "my-read-api-key",
    "description": "My optional description about this collection of products",
    "language": "english",
    "embeddings": {
      "model": "BGESmall",
      "document_fields": ["title", "description"]
    }
  }'
```
</Tabs>

In the next sections, we'll explain each of the parameters in detail.

### Parameters

| Name           | Type     | Description | Required | Default |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| `id`         | `string`   | The id of the collection. | Yes | - |
| `write_api_key` | `string`   | The write API key for this collection. | Yes | - |
| `read_api_key`  | `string`   | The read API key for this collection. | Yes | - |
| `description`   | `string`   | A description for this collection. | No | - |
| `language`      | `string`   | The language of the documents in this collection. | No | `english` |
| `embeddings`    | `object`   | The configuration for text embeddings. | No | - |

The `embeddings` object is the parameter used by OramaCore to configure text embeddings generation for the documents in this collection.

The `embeddings` object has the following parameters:

| Name             | Type     | Description | Required | Default |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| `model`          | `string`   | The model to use for text embeddings generation. | No | `MultilingualE5Small` |
| `document_fields` | `string[]` | The fields to use for text embeddings generation. If not specified, OramaCore will use all the string fields found in the documents. | No | - |

Read more about text embeddings and their configurations [here](/docs/text-embeddings).

## Hooks

After creating a collection, you can start using some hooks. If you're not familiar with hooks, you can read more about them in the [Hooks](/docs/javascript-hooks/introduction) section.


At the time of writing, we have the following hooks available:

- `selectEmbeddingProperties`: Allows you to programmatically select properties for text extraction during text embeddings generation.

  <Tabs groupId='hooks' persist items={['cURL']}>
  ```bash tab="cURL"
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/{COLLECTION_ID}/v0/hooks/add \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "id": "selectEmbeddingProperties",
      "code": "function selectEmbeddingProperties(document) { return document.title; }"
    }'
  ```
  </Tabs>
