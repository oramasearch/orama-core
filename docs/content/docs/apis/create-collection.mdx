import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

<Callout type='warn'>
At the time of writing, the OramaCore APIs are in beta. We can guarantee that the APIs **will change** in a way that breaks existing applications.

We will make these APIs stable in the v1.0.0 release, planned for February 28th, 2025.
</Callout>

We can think of collections as a way to group documents together.

For example, if you want to index all the products in your e-commerce store, you might want to create a collection called `products`, where each document represents a single product.

## APIs

Creating a new collection is as simple as:

<Tabs groupId='create' persist items={['cURL']}>

```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v0/collections \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -d '{ "name": "products" }'
```

</Tabs>

## Hooks

After creating a collection, you can start using some hooks. If you're not familiar with hooks, you can read more about them in the [Hooks](/docs/javascript-hooks/introduction) section.


At the time of writing, we have the following hooks available:

- `selectEmbeddingProperties`: Allows you to programmatically select properties for text extraction during text embeddings generation.

  <Tabs groupId='hooks' persist items={['cURL']}>
  ```bash tab="cURL"
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/{COLLECTION_ID}/v0/hooks/add \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "id": "selectEmbeddingProperties",
      "code": "function selectEmbeddingProperties(document) { return document.title; }"
    }'
  ```
  </Tabs>
