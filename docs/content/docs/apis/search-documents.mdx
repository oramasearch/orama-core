<Callout type='warn'>
At the time of writing, the OramaCore APIs are in beta. We can guarantee that the APIs **will change** in a way that breaks existing applications.

We will make these APIs stable in the v1.0.0 release, planned for February 28th, 2025.
</Callout>

## APIs

<Callout>
API Key type: **`read_api_key`**.
</Callout>

To search for documents in a collection, you can use the following API:

<Tabs groupId='search' persist items={['cURL']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v0/collections/{COLLECTION_ID}/search?api-key=<read_api_key> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "term": "The quick brown fox" }'
```
</Tabs>

The API will return a list of documents that match the search term. The documents will be sorted by relevance, with the most relevant documents appearing first.

## Search Parameters

When performing search, you can use a number of parameters to customize the search results:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `term` | The search term. | - |
| `mode` | The search mode. Can be `fulltext`, `vector`, or `hybrid`. | `fulltext` |
| `limit` | The maximum number of documents to return. | `10` |
| `offset` | The number of documents to skip. | `0` |
| `properties` | The properties to search in. <br />Should be an array of strings (for example: `["title", "description", "author.name"]`) | All properties |
| `where` | A filter to apply to the search results. Read more [here](#where-filters) | - |

### Where Filters

At index time, OramaCore will index different datatypes in different ways. For example, a `string` will be indexed differently than a `number` or a `boolean`.

When performing a search, you can use the `where` parameter to filter the search results based on the datatype of the property.

#### Filtering Numbers

To filter numbers, you can use the following operators:

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eq` | Equal to | `{"where": {"age": {"eq": 25}}}` |
| `lt` | Less than | `{"where": {"age": {"lt": 25}}}` |
| `lte` | Less than or equal to | `{"where": {"age": {"lte": 25}}}` |
| `gt` | Greater than | `{"where": {"age": {"gt": 25}}}` |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal to | `{"where": {"age": {"gte": 25}}}` |
| `between` | Between two values | `{"where": {"age": {"between": [20, 30]}}}` |

So a full query complete with a `where` filter might look like this:

```json
{
  "term": "John Doe",
  "where": {
    "age": {
      "gte": 25
    }
  }
}
```

#### Filtering Booleans

To filter booleans, you can use the following operators:

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `true` | True | `{"where": {"is_active": true}}` |
| `false` | False | `{"where": {"is_active": false}}` |

So a full query complete with a `where` filter might look like this:

```json
{
  "term": "John Doe",
  "where": {
    "is_active": true
  }
}
```

### Facets

OramaCore supports faceted search. You can use the `facets` parameter to get a list of facets for a given property.

### Numeric Facets

The `facets` parameter can be used to get numeric facets. For example, to get a histogram of the `price` property, you can use the following query:

```json
{
  "term": "Bluetooth Airbuds",
  "facets": {
    "price": {
      "ranges": [
        { "from": 0, "to": 50 },
        { "from": 50, "to": 100 },
        { "from": 100, "to": 200 },
        { "from": 200, "to": 500 },
        { "from": 500, "to": 1000 },
        { "from": 1000 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Boolean Facets

The `facets` parameter can also be used to get boolean facets. For example, to get a list of `available` values, you can use the following query:

```json
{
  "term": "Bluetooth Airbuds",
  "facets": {
    "available": {
      "true": true,
      "false": false
    }
  }
}
```
